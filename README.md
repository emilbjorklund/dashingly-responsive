# About this thing.

So, this entry won the whole thing.

You can read about the jury motivation etc at the [MS Edge Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/11/04/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2016-10k-apart-contest/)

The actual [competition entry site](https://dashingly-responsive-10kapart2016.azurewebsites.net/) has an old version of the code, which **no longer works in some browsers** – e.g. Chrome needs to call `AudioContext.resume` after a user gesture after playing any audio, which wasn’t a thing in 2016. The code has since been amended (but is still way below 10Kb).
